## My process
 
I needed to find a lot of information and solve some important problems that scared me at first, but I was able to do it! I continue to move forward.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Starting with the mobile and making sure it's good; before continuing with the other layouts is an efficient workflow.
- Before you start writing, you should study the situation well. A well organized html file makes working with css easy.

I used these elements for the first time :
```css
*, *:before, *:after {
   box-sizing: inherit;
}
```
The Orange background overlay blend initiall was a bit off, found out that background-blend-mode should be used instea of a linear gradient.

```css
background-image: url(../../assets/mobile/image-phone-and-keyboard.jpg);
background-color: hsla(22, 89%, 52%, 1);
background-blend-mode: multiply ;
```
